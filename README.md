## What is Identity Server?

Identity Server is a customizable authentication solution for .NET applications. It handles identity management, single sign-on (SSO), token issuance, and API access control. Built on open standards, it ensures compatibility with modern authentication systems.

---

## Key Features

1. **OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0**:  
   - Implements these widely-used standards for secure authentication and authorization.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:  
   - Allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications.
3. **Token-Based Authentication**:  
   - Issues secure tokens (e.g., JWT) for API and resource access.
4. **Customizable and Extensible**:  
   - Fully customizable workflows and integration with external systems.
5. **Federated Authentication**:  
   - Supports external identity providers like Google, Facebook, Azure AD, and more.
6. **API Protection**:  
   - Provides fine-grained access control for APIs and microservices.
7. **Cross-Platform Support**:  
   - Works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, Linux, and containers.

## How Identity Server Works

1. **Identity Provider (IdP)**:  
   - Acts as the central system for authentication.
2. **Token Issuance**:  
   - Generates and validates tokens for accessing resources.
3. **Federated Identity**:  
   - Integrates with external IdPs for authentication.
4. **Authorization**:  
   - Validates user permissions for accessing resources.
